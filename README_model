README file to the model and how it behaves. There is some more of theoretical divagation in the Python code itself, probably not the best thing to put it there...

The model is meant to be forgetting instances from memory.
One question is: which instances?
- Is it uniformly sampled from current instances?
- Is it sampled following, say, normal distribution (forget most from the 'centre', and less from the tails.
- Maybe something like (1/normal) - tall at the edges and low in the centre. That way the instances from the boundary would be forgotten most often.

I guess however, that just a uniform forgetting mechanism would mean that the actual data will speak for itself.
